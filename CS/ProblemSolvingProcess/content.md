# Problem Solving Process

## 1. Define

**Definition:** Clearly understand and define the problem. Identify the root cause and gather all the necessary information.

**Example:**
The machine on the assembly line keeps stopping randomly.

**Define:**
Understand that the issue is the machineâ€™s unexpected stops. Gather data on when and how it happens.

## 2. Prepare

**Definition:** Plan potential solutions. Brainstorm ideas, gather resources, and consider possible approaches.

**Example:**
Brainstorm possible causes like faulty wiring, overheating, or software glitches. Plan to inspect the machine's components and test each hypothesis.

## 3. Try

**Definition:** Implement the solution. Test the planned solution in a controlled environment or apply it step by step.

**Example:**
Test by replacing a faulty component or adjusting software settings. Monitor if the machine stops unexpectedly after the changes.

## 4. Reflect

**Definition:** Assess the outcome of the solution. Did it work? What could be improved? Reflect on how effective the solution was.

**Example:**
After a week of testing, determine whether the machine continues to operate smoothly. If it still malfunctions, revisit the Prepare phase for further investigation.
